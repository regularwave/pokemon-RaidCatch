# pokemon-RaidCatch
Shows which pokemon can be in raid dens and some info about where those dens are.

## Why?
I'm trying to complete (as much as I can) a beast ball living dex. Pokemon in raids have a 100% catch rate.

## Locations
### Sowrd & Shield
Pokemon can show up in specific raid dens - Serebii's numbering is used.

### Scarlet & Violet
The occupant of a den is randomly chosen from the pool of available pokemon for that den's ☆ rating. As you progress through the game, the ☆ rating of your avilable raid dens will increase and you will eventually no longer see 1☆ or 2☆ dens.

## Catch rate
### Sword & Shield
For ***non-event*** dens where you are the host (or if you're offline and just walk up to the den), the catch rate is 100% with any ball once defeated.

### Scarlet & Violet
Pokemon in raid dens have a 100% catch rate with any ball once defeated.
